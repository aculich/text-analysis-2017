    "## Dictionary Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most simple way to measure the prevelence of a theme in a corpus, and is used for many purposes, including sentiment analysis. This is one of the most long-standing, and ubiquitous, methods in automated text analysis, so it's important to both understand the method and be able to implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method is simple: it involves grouping words into categories or themes, and then counting the number of words from each theme in your corpus. We will use this method to do sentiment analysis, a popular text analysis task, on our Music Review corpus, using a standard sentiment analysis dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "* Understand the intuition behind the dictionary method\n",
    "* Learn how to implement in via Python Pandas and NLTK\n",
    "* Get more comfortable combining Python packages together\n",
    "* Implement a rudimentary sentiment analysis tool and test it on our Music Reviews data.\n",

    "    * the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc., is positive, negative, or neutral.\n",

    "The dictionary method is based on the assumption that themes or categories consist of a group of words, and texts that cover that theme will have a higher percentage of that group of words compared to other texts. Dictionary methods are used for many purposes. A few possibilities:\n",
    "* classify text into themes\n",
    "* measure the *tone* of text\n",
    "* measure sentiment\n",
    "* measure psychological processes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two forms of dictionaries: standard or general dictionaries, and custom dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of standard dictionaries that have been created by field experts. The benefit of standarized dictionaries is that they're developed by experts and have been throughoughly validated. Others have likely published using these dictionaries, so reviewers are more likely to accept them as valid. Because of this, they are good options if they fit your research question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [DICTION](http://www.dictionsoftware.com/): a computer-aided text analysis program for determining the tone of a text. It was created by and for organization scholars and political scientists.\n",
    "    * Main five categories: Certainty, Activity, Optimism, Realism, Commonality\n",
    "    * 35 sub-categories\n",
    "    * Allows you to create your own dictionary\n",
    "    * Proprietary software\n",
    "* [Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)](http://liwc.wpengine.com/): Created by psychologists, it's meant to capture psychological processes around feelings, personality, and motivations. It's also proprietary.\n",
    "* [Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA)](http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/): The free version of LIWC. We will use this dictionary today.\n",
    "* [Harvard General Inquirer](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/spreadsheet_guide.htm). Multiple categories, including abstract and concrete words. It's free and available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Many research questions or data are domain specific, however, and will thus require you to create your own dictionary based on your own knowledge of the domain and question. Creating your own dictionary requires a lot of thought, and must be validated. These dictionaries are typically created in an interative fashion, and are modified as they are validated. See Enns et al. (2015) for an example of how they constructed their own dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will use the free and standard sentiment dictionary from MPQA to measure positive and negative sentiment in the music reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step, as with any technique, is the pre-processing step, to get the data ready for analyis."
